# Web scraping project using Python

The goal of this project is to use web scraping to extract data from different supermarkets' websites and analyze changes over time and the best deals for some common bought products. The library Beautiful Soup is being used. 

The code is available in [this file](https://github.com/clayamakita/webscraping_project_01/blob/main/webscraping_01.py) and the idea is to develop it over time, to include other websites, other products and register the prices on a daily or weekly basis.
